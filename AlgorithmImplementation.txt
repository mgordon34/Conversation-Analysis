Below is the current functionlity of Analyze. Analyze can create/do the following:
    1. a dictionary of words from the NCR-Hashtag-Emotion-Lexicon library. This library maps words to
    scores given by certain emotions. It also works with emoticons.
        emotionDict
    2. a dictionary using the Vader_lexicon to be used for mapping words to general sentiment scores
    ranging from -1 to 1, where the more negative the score, the more negative the sentiment is associated with the word.
        sentimentDict
    3. a line by line postive, negative, neutral and compound sentiment score for a particular speaker.
        getSentimentData(self, tp, speaker)
    4. a list of the speaker's emotion scores for a particular emotion for all of his lines.
        getEmotionSpeaker
    5. creates a JASON object to be used for plotly
        plotlyEmotion
    6. a scatter plot using py plot. We track all of the speakers' (inputted as strings) emotion scores
    on the given emotion
        scatterGraphEmotion
    7. Creates a scatter plot of the speakers in teh speaker array and the sentiment desired.
    possible sentiments: pos, neg, neu, compound
        scatterPlotSentiment
    8. Calculates the average compound, negative, neutral and positive scores of all speakers in the conversation
        to determine the overall sentiment of the conversation (compound, negative, neutral, positive)
        getAverageConversationScores
    9. calculates the desired emotion scores for each sentence said by the desired speaker.
        getAverageEmotionScore
    10.calculates the sentiment of each word in the dialog according to the vader text document.
        Scores go from a range of -1 to 1.
        -1 is negative----- 0 neutral ----- 1 positive
        getVaderSentimentOfWords
    11. Compare the overall emotion a single speaker feels toward a single recipient or everyone in the group.
        emotAverageBwSpeakers
    12. Compare the overall sentiment a single speaker feels toward a single recipient or everyone in the group.
        sentimentAverageBwSpeakers
    13. calculates the average sentiment of the entire conversation based on the vader lexicon text document. Scores
    range from -1 to 1. -1 represents a very negative sentiment while 1 represent an overall postive sentiment.
        getAverageVaderSentimentWords

Algorithm Stages:
    1. First we will read in the document, for each line we keep track of the following information:
        -the speaker
        -the recipient
        -the time stamp
        -the contents of the line
        -the date
        -the emotion scores of each line
        self.emotions =  {"anticipation":[], "fear":[], "anger":[], "trust":[], "surprise":[], "sadness":[], "joy":[], "disgust":[]}
        self.sentiment = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0,0.0]
    2. We then calculate the sentiment scores of each sentence based on the Vader Library.
      Each sentence gets a positive, negative, neutral and a compound score.
    3. We also run a sentiment analysis on each sentence on the word level by using the Vader Library for words as well
        as the SemEval2015-English-Twitter-Lexicon. Each word is assigned a score from -1 to 1, where negative 1
        corresponds the most negative sentiment and 1 corresponds to the most positive.
    4. We run an emotion analysis on the word level for each sentiment using the NRC-Hashtag-Emotion-Lexicon. Each word
       is mapped to a value ranging from 1 to 1, where negative 1 corresponds the most unlike that emotion and 1 corresponds to the most like that emotion.
    5. We can then use this data to focus in on a particular speaker to see how he felt to the overall group and the
    overall emotion he felt while conversing with the group or an individual person if desired.
    6. We also then calculate the average conversation score for each emotion by taking the average emotion scores over all
    speakers toward a single person as well as their dialog towards everyone in the group.
